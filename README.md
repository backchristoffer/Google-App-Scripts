## Google-App-Scripts
Collection of my google app scripts I use for productivity

###
[Google Sheet - Delete duplicate + row](delete-duplicates-plus-row.js)
- Easier for me to use this script when deleting duplicate names in a column and also the related row to that name. 

[Remove https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ from the URL all rows in column ](remove-url-rows-in-column.js)
- When I have a column of many hundreds of rows with OCPBUGS url that needs to be cleaned up for later use. 

[Highlight duplicate rows in a column](highlight-duplicates-row.js)
- When I deal with hundreds of rows of bugs I need a way to highlight the duplicates.
